Conventional Machine learning model works with batch data. To train the model we need all the data at once.

If we want to work with new data, we need to add the previous data with new data and train the model from scratch.

Incremental Learning help us from this. There is a library called **river**, that can work with new data. It trains the model when new data is available.
